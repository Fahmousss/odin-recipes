<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is loved all over the world. It is a
  layered pasta dish that is typically made with wide, flat noodles, a savory
  meat sauce, a creamy ricotta cheese filling, and a melty mozzarella cheese
  topping. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until it is golden brown and
  bubbly.
</p>
<p>
  Lasagna is a versatile dish that can be made with a variety of different
  ingredients. Some popular variations include vegetarian lasagna, which is made
  without meat, and white lasagna, which is made with a white sauce instead of a
  tomato sauce. Lasagna can also be made with different types of pasta, such as
  whole-wheat lasagna or gluten-free lasagna.

    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Cheese Filling:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) container small-curd cottage cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lasagna Assembly</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles (no pre-boiling needed)</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Make the Meat Sauce:</b> Sauté the onion and garlic in olive oil until
    softened. Add the ground beef and pork (if using) and cook until browned.
    Drain any excess fat. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley,
    basil, oregano, salt, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes,
    or until thickened.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Make the Cheese Filling:</b> In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese,
    Parmesan cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Assemble the Lasagna:</b> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin
    layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange
    lasagna noodles in a single layer to cover the bottom (you may need to break
    some noodles to fit).
  </li>

  <li>
    Layer on half of the cheese mixture, followed by half of the remaining meat
    sauce. Sprinkle with half of the mozzarella cheese.
  </li>

  <li>
    Repeat the layers with remaining noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce, and
    mozzarella cheese.
  </li>

  <li>
    Cover the dish with aluminum foil (tented slightly to avoid sticking to the
    cheese). Bake for 30-40 minutes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese
    is golden brown and bubbly.
  </li>

  <li>
    Let the lasagna cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
    This allows the layers to set and prevents the lasagna from falling apart.
  </li>
