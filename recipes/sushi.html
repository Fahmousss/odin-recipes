    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
      <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
      <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups
        of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.
      </li>

      <li>
        Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice
        on a plate until completely cool.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool
        rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the
        seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on
        rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch
        away from the bottom edge of seaweed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to
        the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8
        equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.
      </li>
    </ol>
